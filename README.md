# SMU-Project-1-NFL-Arrests
SMU Data Bootcamp

****Project Objectives**:**
1. Choose an interesting and insightful dataset to answer research questions
2. Read a CSV dataset into Pandas and use data cleaning and manipulation methods to prepare our data
3. Create a regression to find a relationship between two data fields
4. Create data visualizations to visualize the conclusions made for our research questions

**Project Topic:** For our project, we tried to find trends and correlations in NFL games such as game attendance, the gap of the score, start time of the game, and more to determine if we can predict the number of arrests that occur at a NFL stadium on a game day. Throughout our project we also found other insights in addition to arrests.

**What We Did:**
For this project we used 3 csv files from Kaggle for our data: NFL Games, NFL Attendance, and NFL Arrests. We first cleaned our data by removing playoff games in the NFL games datasets and changing the New York Giants and New York Jets "home city" to NYG and NYJ, respectively. After cleaning the data we created a concatenated column from "year", "week", and "home city". With this newly created column we merged all 3 of our datasets into 1 to begin statistical testing and data visualizations. To answer our research questions we used regressions, conducted ANOVA and T-tests, and created data visualizations to make data-driven conclusions.

**With this dataset, we wanted to answer the following research questions:**

Is there any correlation between the total attendance of an NFL game and the number of arrests on any given game day at that stadium? 
Which stadium is the most dangerous (which stadium has the most arrests)? 
Is there any correlation between score gap and total number of arrests on that game day? 
What time of the day of games has the most arrests? 
Does stadium type (domed or open roofed) have any relationship with arrests? 
What game day of the week has the best attendance per stadium?
How strong is home field advantage?

For details of the work done during this project please view the 'Reports' folder for our final presentation and write up. Our 'Code' folder will showcase the work done in Pandas, and the 'Data' folder documents our csv datasets from Kaggle, as well as, our cleaned and merged dataset.
